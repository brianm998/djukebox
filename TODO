bugs:
 - deleting currently playing song while playing when paused causes immediate play of next song
 - can't exit app anymore (close button should close the app, 'command Q' works)
 
new features:

test the server on linux (compiles, make sure it actually works too..)
 - make sure the linux compilation still works, and test the audio there
enable replays from history (dragging of rows?)
figure out external accessability, right now only localhost works :( 
better logging (copy from iOS)
get custom swipe gestures working on lists, swiftui buttons disappear on lists :(
synchronize the similar parts of the audio player into a superclass
add volume control
handle empty audio buffer better (wait to start playing until full, show in ui)
move mp3 files to /tmp

db access to record
 - number of plays
 - access creds?? (maybe not in DB)
 - playlists
 - audio level per track
 - full set of tracks (faster server startup times)
 - playing history
